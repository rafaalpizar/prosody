### Breaking changes

* Move global ssl section to https_ssl and legacy_ssl_ssl section. It is only needed there. #3
  * <https://prosody.im/doc/ports#ssl_configuration>

As explained in the [README](https://github.com/SaraSmiseth/prosody#ssl-certificates) this setup uses automatic location to find your certs. This did not work correctly before this change. It just always used the main certificate defined with the global `ssl` config setting. This setting was removed and for the [services](https://prosody.im/doc/certificates#service_certificates) that do not use automatic location new global settings were introduced. These are `legacy_ssl_ssl` and `https_ssl`.

* Add badges to README. Fixes #5.
